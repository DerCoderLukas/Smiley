# Smiley

Small smiley system that allows animated heads to be easily adjusted and carried.

# Requirements

• Java 14

• Spigot 1.16.1

# Installation

The installation of the plugin is very simple and can be done via the following steps.

• Download the jar from the release area.

• Put the jar in your plugins folder of your server and start it.

# Configuration

New smileys can only be added when the server is shutdown. These can be set in the file plugins / Smiley / smileys.yml. I recommend the tool https://mineskin.org/ to convert skins easily online.
